    Code:
    ${code}

    Question:
    ${question}

    Provide feedback in the following format:

    1. **Question Understanding and Purpose**:
      - Briefly restate the question to confirm understanding.
      - Does the code address the question's requirements and constraints?
    
    2. ** Language Used **:
      - Specifiy which language is used here for the code 
      - Highlight if any error are present in the code 

    3. **Functionality Check**:
      - Verify if the code produces the correct output for a range of test cases, including edge cases.
      - Identify any input validation or error-handling considerations.


    4. **Efficiency & Performance**:
      - Evaluate time and space complexity, suggesting optimizations if possible.
      - Mention if loops, recursive calls, or data structures could be optimized or simplified.

    5. **Code Quality & Best Practices**:
      - Check if the code follows best practices for its language, such as naming conventions and indentation.
      - Are variable names, functions, and classes well-named and clear in their purpose?
      - Assess modularity and whether functions/classes could improve reusability.

    6. **Readability & Documentation**:
      - Evaluate if the code logic is easy to follow. Suggest ways to improve readability if needed.
      - Check for comments where necessary, providing clarity on complex sections.

    7. **Suggested Improvements**:
      - Offer actionable suggestions to improve the codeâ€™s readability, efficiency, or modularity.
      - Recommend alternative approaches or tests to cover overlooked edge cases if any.
    
    8.**Test Cases and Corrections**:
      - If the code is correct, provide test cases to verify the code's functionality.
      - If the code is incorrect, provide the corrected code along with explanations.
